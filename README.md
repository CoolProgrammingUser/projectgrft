# Project GRFT
Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has demonstrated a need for cheap and effective antivirals which aren't restricted by cold-chain requirements or pharmaceutical company patents. With the relatively recent discovery of the griffithsin protein (GRFT), it's become possible to engineer organisms to produce a broadly effective antiviral; however, access is still limited. With the help of the volunteers running Project GRFT, it's our hope that we can insert the griffithsin gene into a variety of rice which can then be grown all around the world and be dried and shipped to wherever there's a need for antivirals.
